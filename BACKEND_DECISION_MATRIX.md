## 🚦 RISK ASSESSMENT

### 🟢 LOW RISK (Safe to proceed)
- MongoDB migration (well-documented process)
- Cloudinary integration (simple API)
- OpenAI integration (stable API)
- Heroku deployment (proven platform)

### 🟡 MEDIUM RISK (Manageable)
- Email automation reliability (need good error handling)
- Clerk JWT validation (need thorough testing)
- Statistics calculation performance (can optimize later)

### 🔴 HIGH RISK (Needs attention)
- Email rate limits (Gmail 500/day - may need upgrade)
- Heroku sleep time (free tier sleeps - need $7/month dyno)
- OpenAI costs (can escalate - need monitoring)

**Mitigation:**
- Start with $7/month Heroku dyno (always on)
- Monitor OpenAI usage closely
- Plan for email service upgrade if volume increases
