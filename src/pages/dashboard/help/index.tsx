    question: "Email automation isn't working - no applications are coming in.",
    answer:
      "Check these: 1) Go to Settings > Email Automation and make sure the account is not paused (should show a pause icon, not a play icon). 2) Make sure 'Auto Process Resumes' is turned ON. 3) Verify people are actually sending emails to that address. 4) Check if there are errors shown next to the email account.

    question: "The application drawer is showing incomplete information.",
    answer:
      "This usually means the resume couldn't be fully parsed (converted to text). For email automation applications, try asking the sender to send a cleaner resume format (PDF or DOCX). For manual applications, you may need to fill in missing fields manually by editing the candidate profile after approval.",

    question: "I approved an application but can't find the candidate.",
    answer:
      "When you approve an application, it becomes a candidate. Go to the 'Candidates' page (not Applications page) and search for their name. They should be there, assigned to the job they applied for, in the first stage of the pipeline.",

    answer:
      "Long names, emails, or job titles are automatically shortened to fit in the table. Hover over any truncated text to see the full content in a tooltip. You can also click the row to open detailed view where all information is shown in full.",

    question: "How often should I review new applications?",
    answer:
      "Check applications at least once daily if you're actively hiring. Quick response times (within 24-48 hours) improve candidate experience and increase acceptance rates. Set up email notifications in Settings so you're alerted when new applications arrive.",

    question: "Should I use tags for candidates?",
    answer:
      "Yes! Tags make searching and organizing much easier. Create tags for: skills (JavaScript, Marketing), levels (Junior, Senior), preferences (Remote, Relocation), and specialties (Frontend, B2B Sales). Tag candidates as you review them - it takes 5 seconds but saves hours of searching later.",

    answer:
      "Use clear, specific job titles (like 'Senior React Developer - Remote' not just 'Developer'). Add detailed descriptions and requirements. Set realistic pipeline stages. Close jobs when filled - don't leave old jobs as 'Active' because it confuses tracking and analytics.",
